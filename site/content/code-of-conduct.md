title: Code of Conduct
---

The community of participants of ImageXD is made up of members from
around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and
experiences. It is through these differences that our community
experiences success and continued growth. We expect everyone in our
community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others both
inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to keep ours a
positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community.

As members of the community,

- We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment-
  and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation,
  gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size,
  race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual
  language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary
  jokes are not appropriate.

- We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing
  acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we
  pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or
  acknowledged.

- We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and
  realize that including people with a variety of opinions and
  backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular,
  discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies,
  programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be
  done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all
  participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely
  express their opinions.

- We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully,
  paying particular attention to those new to the community.

- We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider
  community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive
  to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and
  disagreement, both within our community and where we are
  criticized. We will treat those outside our community with the same
  respect as people within our community.

- We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct,
  and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of
  conduct.  We will take action when members of our community violate
  this code such as notifying a workshop organizer or talking
  privately with the person.

This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and
offline, including the conference itself, mailing lists, forums,
social media, social events associates with the conference, and
one-to-one interactions.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to
leave the event at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.
